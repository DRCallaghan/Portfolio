# <Portfolio>

## Description

My Portfolio is my personal webpage dedicated to showcasing my best work, specifically with web development and other technical skills.

- Before uploading this, I did not have a Portfolio site.
- Creating this was good practice for writing new CSS in particular.

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Installation

This website is intended to be run via any web browser, but you should use Chrome or Firefox for best results. Download the whole folder from this repository, then open the index.html file in your browser. For those not wanting to host this website locally, you can use a [live deployed version here](https://drcallaghan.github.io/Portfolio/).

## Usage

After installation, usage should be the same as any other webpage, just hosted locally on your PC. See screenshots for more details about how the website should look.
